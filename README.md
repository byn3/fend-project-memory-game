# Memory Game Project

## Installation Instructions

Open index.html in your web browser.  
Enjoy!  

## Gameplay

* Flip a card. Each card flip is considered one 'move' and the number of moves will determine your star rank.  
* The player will then flip another card and if the symbol matches, the cards will turn green.  
* If they do not match, then the cards will flip back over.  
* The game ends when all cards have been matched.  
* 3 star is 20 moves or less, 2 star 38 moves or less, and 1 star is more than 38.

## Requirements and dependencies

* A computer and an internet connection.  


### Contributors

Udacity provided the skeleton of this project (https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) containing the HTML and CSS.  
I handled the Javascript section (app.js) and used jQuery, font-awesome, and sweetalert2.  
This was done as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program which I earned a scholarship in.  
This project falls under the sections: web foundations and programming with Javascript.  

#### Bugs

Currently matched cards may be reselected. I'm not sure if I want to allow or disallow this.
